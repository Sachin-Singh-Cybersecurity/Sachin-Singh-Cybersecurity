# Day 18 – OWASP Top 10 (2025)
**Date:** 31 December 2025  
**Focus:** Understand OWASP Top 10:2025 and map each risk to real attack + detection ideas for our Azure lab.

---

## 1. Why OWASP Top 10 Matters

The OWASP Top 10 is the most widely used list of critical web application security risks and is treated as a de‑facto standard by security teams and auditors.
The 2025 edition shifts focus from single bugs to broader, ecosystem and SDLC risks like **software supply chain failures** and **mis-handled exceptional conditions**. 

**How this fits our plan:**

- Day 18 reading and notes will:
  - Feed directly into the **Week 2+ web app assessment projects**.
  - Give language to describe findings in professional reports.
  - Help design detection rules and logging requirements later.

## 3. Category‑by‑Category Notes 

### A01:2025 – Broken Access Control

**Idea:** Users can do things they are **not supposed** to do (access other users’ data, admin features, etc.).

- Examples:
  - Regular user can call `/admin/deleteUser?id=5`.
  - IDOR: change `?userId=100` to `?userId=101` and see another user’s data.
- In our projects:
  - DVWA / custom apps: test role boundaries (user vs admin).
  - AD lab: test if low-priv user can access admin-only shares.

**Checklist for practice (Day 18):**

- [ ] Written 3 test cases for broken access control in a sample app.
- [ ] Noted what logs would be needed to detect role abuse.

---

### A02:2025 – Security Misconfiguration

**Idea:** Default settings, exposed admin panels, verbose errors, open S3 buckets, unnecessary features enabled.

- Examples:
  - Debug mode enabled in production.
  - Default credentials on admin panel.
  - Directory listing enabled.
- In our projects:
  - IIS/Apache/Nginx defaults on lab VMs.
  - Azure: open management ports, default NSG rules, unnecessary services.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Listed 5 misconfig examples specific to Azure + my lab stack.
- [ ] Mapped which config checks will go into my Week 1–2 hardening docs.

---

### A03:2025 – Software Supply Chain Failures

**Idea:** Compromised dependencies, build systems, CI/CD, package managers, images. Expanded from “Vulnerable and Outdated Components” to full supply chain.

- Examples:
  - Malicious NPM/PyPI package.
  - Compromised build runner injecting backdoors.
- In our projects:
  - Docker images for web apps.
  - Third-party libs in web app assessment.
  - Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions later.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Noted where my lab pulls third‑party packages (pip, npm, apt).
- [ ] Added “SBOM / dependency review” as a future project step.

---

### A04:2025 – Cryptographic Failures

**Idea:** Using crypto incorrectly or not at all, leading to data exposure. This used to be “Sensitive Data Exposure” but now focuses on root cause.

- Examples:
  - HTTP instead of HTTPS.
  - Weak TLS ciphers, self‑signed certs where not appropriate.
  - Storing passwords in plaintext or using broken algorithms (e.g., MD5).
- In our projects:
  - Check TLS config for any external web interface.
  - Check how passwords are stored in lab apps.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Written 3 checks I will run on any web app’s crypto (TLS/passwords).

---

### A05:2025 – Injection

**Idea:** Untrusted data interpreted as code/queries (SQL, OS, LDAP, NoSQL). Still in top 5, but dropped from #1.  

- Examples:
  - SQL injection (`' OR 1=1--`).
  - Command injection (`; cat /etc/passwd`).
- In our projects:
  - DVWA SQLi and command injection modules.
  - Logging queries for SIEM detection rules later.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] List 2 manual tests and 2 automated tests for injection in DVWA.
- [ ] Note: which logs would show an injection attempt?

---

### A06:2025 – Insecure Design

**Idea:** The system is insecure **by design**, even if implementation is bug‑free.  

- Examples:
  - No rate limiting by design.
  - Business logic allows money transfer reversal abuse.
- In our projects:
  - When designing my SOC or incident response process, ask:
    - “If an attacker follows the normal workflow, can they still abuse it?”

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Written 2 examples of insecure design I’ve seen (even in simple apps).
- [ ] Added “design review” step into my later project templates.

---

### A07:2025 – Authentication Failures

**Idea:** Anything that breaks identification of the user: weak login, bad session handling, no MFA, etc. 

- Examples:
  - Session ID in URL.
  - No lockout on repeated failed logins.
  - Reusing passwords across services.
- In our projects:
  - Lab AD policies, web app login flows, Azure AD conditional access later.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Mapped how I will test login strength for any app:
  - Password policy.
  - Brute‑force protection.
  - Session cookie flags.

---

### A08:2025 – Software or Data Integrity Failures

**Idea:** Trusting unverified data/software: unsigned updates, insecure deserialization, unsafe CI artifacts. Evolved from 2021’s “Software and Data Integrity Failures.” 

- Examples:
  - App auto‑updates over HTTP.
  - Deserializing untrusted JSON/XML without validation.
- In our projects:
  - Any scripts or tools I download into my lab (PowerShell, Python).
  - Future: checking integrity of logs and backups.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Note 3 places in my lab where integrity matters (scripts, backups, configs).

---

### A09:2025 – Logging & Alerting Failures

**Idea:** Missing, incomplete, or ignored logs leading to undetected attacks. Expanded from “Security Logging and Monitoring Failures.” 

- Examples:
  - No logging for failed logins.
  - Logs stored locally only, rotated away before analysis.
- In our projects:
  - All my attack exercises will generate logs my can feed into SIEM.
  - my will write detection rules against these in later weeks.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] For each of A01–A08, write “what should be logged” in one line.
- [ ] This becomes input for future SIEM rules.

---

### A10:2025 – Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions

**Idea:** New category focusing on insecure error handling, timeouts, resource exhaustion, and resilience.

- Examples:
  - Verbose stack traces exposed to users.
  - Crashes or timeouts that leak partial data.
  - Not handling network or API failures safely.
- In our projects:
  - How my lab apps behave under error: do they leak secrets?
  - How my scripts handle exceptions (PowerShell/Bash hardening scripts).

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Noted how my current apps handle 500 errors.
- [ ] Added “check error messages for information leaks” to my testing checklist.
